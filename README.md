# Code Monkeys Community Suggestions
Inspired by the dear-github project, this is a repository that uses GitHub Issues to propose changes to be made to the community and express concerns.

The Issues submitted here do not need to strictly be about Code Monkeys Discord. You may submit any suggestion you like; about the website, GitHub organization, etc.

We only ask that you keep the discussion on-topic. You may comment on individual Issues, or discuss them in the `#suggestions` channel of the [Discord Server](https://discord.me/cm).

If there are any changes or extra information that you believe should be added to this repository, feel free to fork and submit a pull request.
